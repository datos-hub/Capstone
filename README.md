Problem Summary

Venue owners cannot count how many fights they have seen every day at their grounds. 
It happens when nobody is expecting and there are always risk to safety of the crowd. 
And specially for venue owners, they also have to deal with damages to the property. 
In clubs, for example, table, chairs, lamps, glasses can all become part of the brawl. 
The crowd that is not involved in the fight, start to leave and quickly one night of profit becomes one night of expenses. 
Normally clubs, for example, are only busy on the weekends, which makes a fight affect their month income.

Problem Statement

Provide a solution that integrates with the surveillance cameras of the venue, and with expression detection, 
advise security guards to move towards the possible “epicenter” of the fight, in order to prevent it from ever happening.
